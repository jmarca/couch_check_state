 * couchdb_check_state(opts,cb)
 * opts = {'db': the couchdb holding the document,
 *         'doc': the document holding the state,
 *         'year': the year to check (any sub key in the doc, really),
 *         'state': the state to get from the doc under the 'year' key,
 * }
 * cb = a callback
 *
 * cb will be called as cb(error,value)
 *
 * The error will contain any error passed from accessing couchdb
 *
 * The value can be null if there is nothing in the document, or will
 * equal the value of doc[year][state]
 *
 * in a special case, if there is doc[state], but nothing at doc[year]
 * and/or if opts.year is not defined, then I will return doc[state]
 *
 * So for example, if you want to check 'rawimpute' in the year 2008
 * for detector 1212432, in a couchdb called 'tracking', you would
 * call with
 *
 * {'db':'tracking',doc':'1212432','year':2008,'state':'rawimpute'}
 *
 * If you want to check 'rawimpute' in the year 2008 for detector
 * 1212432, in a couchdb database named vds_detector/tracking/D12, you
 * could call with
 *
 * {'db':'vds_detector%2ftracking%2f/D12','doc':'1212432',
 *  'year':2008,'state':'rawimpute'}
 *
 *
 *
 * note that I don't make any assumptions about the db or year, aside
 * from the fact that I expect that there will be a couchdb document
 * with that name.  Typically this means the detector id should
 * resolve to some string.  If you have a couchdb with slashes, you
 * should remember to escape those properly, etc
 *
 * If you pass dbroot, it is presumed that the separator is a slash,
 * and if you don't want that, then do not use dbroot, use a full
 * couchdb name passed as detector_id
